## Version Histories 

This article was quite interesting as it provided two different perspectives on the history of humanities and computer science. As the article mentioned, the years 1965 and 1968 were notable for computer science with the invention of MULTICS and UNIX. But most people will remember the humanitarian side of history such as the assianation of Malcolm X and the riots of the 1960’s for social justice. This kind of gives a perspective that computer science origin’s never really involved the humanities. The article also mentioned how programming has to be interdependent from one another

The second article reminds me of IS 199, Command Lines. In this class, we learn the core basics of computing within the terminal. A lot of it involves files and directories, and how to navigate them. But before this class, as the article mentioned, I was a bit clueless about directories in my computer. As the article mentioned, a lot has to do with cloud services such as google drive and OneBox. I still remember the transition from USB drives to cloud storage back in 2011. Before then, a basic understanding of files and directories within your PC was still necessary.
