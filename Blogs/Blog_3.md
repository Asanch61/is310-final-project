## Crowdsourcing Culture & Managing Metadata - DPLA
	
The website Digital Public Library of America is a great resource for primary sources. I remember learning about primary vs secondary sources in my history class and the DLPA is able to provide primary sources that are relevant to one’s search. For example, I searched for riots in the search bar and noticed that I was able to select multiple criteria for the search. Each search has a metadata such as creator, Created Date, partner, contributing institution, collection, publisher, type, format, URL, Standardized Rights Statement, or rights. In my search for riots, I was able to narrow it down from 1960-1969 and the location as Chicago. This a powerful tool for metadata as it provides a lot of content for the source one will be using as it provides a lot contextual 

I actually started to play around with the DLPA archives and see if I could find anything in regards to my final project. So I searched for “lower west side”, which is the neighborhood I am researching for. To my surprise, DLPDA gave me the option to further filter it down to Pilsen, the neighborhood I live in. This was amazing as it gave me a whole bunch of historical pictures of what the neighborhood was like decades ago and how it has transformed. I would have loved to use some of the sources I found, but none of them are csv files. I do plan on using the images for my final blog post though.
