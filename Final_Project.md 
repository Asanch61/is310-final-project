Topic: Gentrification of Pilsen and its effects on the community. 
Background: Pilsen is a neighborhood in Chicago, 20  mins away from the loop, that has historically had a large and influential hispanic population. Over the past decade or so, the neighborhood has been experiencing gentrification and which has affected the local community. 
Question: Has the gentrification of Pilsen had a positive or negative effect on the suitability of the community? 
Proposed Focus:  My initial goals for this project is to determine whether the gentrification of Pilsen over the past decade has had a negative impact on the local community. Specifically, I am trying to study if gentrification is truly as bad as the media often portrays it to be. While from a moral standpoint, it might be morally wrong, the economics and social impacts are not entirely damaging to the community. I am choosing this topic because I have grown up in Pilsen for over a decade and have personally witnessed the gentrification of the neighborhood. As such, it is a topic that not only I am familiar with but one where I am part of the community itself that is being affected.
Outline Work for Project: Alright, this how I will be tackling this project. I plan to use multiple datasets in order to analyze different components and how they have been impacted by gentrification. These will include, rent and real estate values using Zillow, crime rates and types of crime within Pilsen using Chicago Data Portal, demographics such as race, income, education levels, etc., of Pilsen using Chicago Data Portal. I will also be looking into the economics of Pilsen, specifically I want to focus on small businesses as  gentrification often tends to bring bigger corporations that outcompete smaller businesses. I will analyze the type of businesses that operate within Pilsen and their contribution to the local economy. Lastly, I want to look into the relevance of Pilsen outside of the community using Google Trends. Analysis of these components will be based on change over time, 2000 to 2022 , and factors that tend to improve quality of life. After analyzing these components, I will compare the neighborhood of Pilsen with Logan Square, another neighborhood that experienced gentrification but lost its cultural identity, and Little Village, a neighborhood similar to what Pilsen was 20 years ago. These will provide a greater compresehive to the trends that Pilsen is currently experiencing.
