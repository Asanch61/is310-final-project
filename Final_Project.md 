Topic: Gentrification of Pilsen and its effects on the hispanic community. 

Background: Pilsen is a neighborhood in Chicago, 20  mins away from the loop, that has historically had a large and influential hispanic population. Over the past decade or so, the neighborhood has been experiencing gentrification and which has affected the local community. 

Question: Has the gentrification of Pilsen had a positive or negative effect on the sustainability of the hispanic community? 

Proposed Focus:  My initial goals for this project is to determine whether the gentrification of Pilsen over the past decade has had a negative impact on the local community. Specifically, I am trying to study if gentrification is truly as “devastating” to the hispanic community as the media often portrays it to be. While from a moral standpoint, it might be wrong, the economics and social impacts are not entirely damaging to the community. I am choosing this topic because I have grown up in Pilsen for over a decade and have personally witnessed the gentrification of my neighborhood. As such, it is a topic that not only I am familiar with but one where I am part of the community myself

Outline Work for Project: Alright, this how I will be tackling this project. I plan to use multiple datasets in order to analyze different components and how they have been impacted by gentrification. These will include: average rent and real estate values using Zillow, crime rates and types of crime within Pilsen using Chicago Data Portal, demographics such as race, income, education levels, etc., of Pilsen using Chicago Data Portal. I will be looking into the economics of Pilsen as well, specifically I want to focus on small businesses, especially hispanic owned ones,  as  gentrification often tends to bring bigger corporations that outcompete smaller businesses. I will analyze the type of businesses that operate within Pilsen and their contribution to the local economy,e.g white vs blue collar jobs. Lastly, I want to look into the relevance of Pilsen outside of the community using Google Trends and maps.. Analysis of these components will be based on change over time, 2000 to 2022 , and factors that tend to improve quality of life, as well as the physical appearance of the neighborhood using Google Maps from 2007 to 2020. After analyzing these components, I will compare the neighborhood of Pilsen with the neighborhood of Logan Square, another area that went through gentrification which resulted in the erosion of the hispanic community. The 2nd comparison will be made to Little Village, a neighborhood whose current status is similar to what Pilsen was 20 years ago and currently has a  strong hispanic community. These will provide a greater in depth analysis of the current gentrification that Pilsen is undergoing and determine the degree in which it has affected the hispanic community. 

Relation to Reading: The following paragraph or so will act as my literature review, specifically focusing the history and politics of gentrification in Chicago along with charts and data of hispanic immigration and displacement in Chicago. Gentrification itself is a complex term that is defined by the Oxford dictionary as the  process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, typically displacing current inhabitants in the process. While this is an accurate description of gentrification, often there are varying degrees of gentrification and it is not always the case that current inhabitants get displaced. This is what Jackelyn Hwang and Robert J. Sampson researched in their paper, looking into multiple factors of gentrification in Chicago. Sampson and Hwang noted that often when looking at gentrification, most research often tends to focus on the same methodology, which gives back the same results. Instead, Sampson and Hwang decided to look at a wide array of variables, actually quite similar to what I am doing, in order to look at how gentrification has affected local neighborhoods at an individual level. This includes surveys, police records, public investment, retention of local inhabitants, etc. According to Sampson and Hwang, Hispanic and Black neighborhoods tend to receive the least amount of reinvestment and socioeconomic status compared to gentrified neighborhoods that have a threshold of at least 35% white population (2014).  Oftentimes, there is little incentive to invest in low income minority neighborhoods and displacement rates are far greater in these areas compared to low income neighborhoods with a greater white population. Though it is interesting to note that Pilsen might be an exception to this rule to some extent, at least according to Anderson Matthew and Carolina Sternberg research. Anderson and Strenberg (2013) specifically focused their paper on the gentrification of Pilsen and Bronzeville. I actually found their research very interesting. According to the authors, both neighbrhods are expoericibning “a new and emergent form of “non-White” gentrification: the displacement of a low-income non-White population by one of non-White affluence” (2013, pg. 3). The study goes on to describe the unique gentrification that both neighborhoods have had compared to previous gentrification. I feel this study supports my argument that gentrification has not been entirely bad for the hispanic community in Pilsen. 
Detailed Work Plan: Since I am behind in this project, here are the following steps I must take in order to successfully answer my research question and meet deadlines. First, I will look more into research that has been conducted already on gentrification such as the papers that I mentioned in my literature review. This will be the first task in order to have a better understanding on what exactly I should analyze and use for my research. The second task involves web scraping multiple datasets such as Zillow and Chicago Data Portal. This will be the most difficult part and will require most of my attention. In order to stay on track, I have decided that I will create a liability form in which I will personally message Professor LeBlac with updates on what I have web scrapped. It does have to be anything to depth, just updates that will force me to stay on track. After going through data,  I need to develop a coherent structure for the data in order to support my argument. The data must be presented in a way that is readable and visually appealing to the audience.
